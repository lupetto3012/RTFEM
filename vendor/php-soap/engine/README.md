# SOAP Engine

This package contains the contracts and models that allow you to create a customizable SOAP engine.
The design looks like this:

![Engine](docs/engine.png)


* **Driver:** A driver is a combination of an encoder + decoder + metadata that can work together in order to process SOAP requests.
  * **Encoder:** Can encode mixed data into a valid SOAP Request. 
  * **Decoder:** Can decode a SOAP Response into a mixed data result.
  * **Metadata:** Processes the WSDL and returns a collection of available types and methods.
* **Transport:** Sends the HTTP SOAP Request and receives the HTTP SOAP Response.

Every component above can be used seperately in order to create your own customized SOAP Engine.

# Installation

```shell
composer install php-soap/engine
```

## Engines

This package provides engines that can be used in a generic way:

### SimpleEngine

The SimpleEngine is a wrapper around a previous defined `Driver` and a `Transport` implementation.

```php
use Soap\Engine\SimpleEngine;

$engine = new SimpleEngine($driver,$transport);
```

### LazyEngine

You don't want to be loading WSDL files or SOAP services if you don't need to.
By wrapping an engine in a lazy engine, you can prevent any WSDL loading from happening before actually requesting a resource.

```php
use Soap\Engine\SimpleEngine;
use Soap\Engine\LazyEngine;

$engine = new LazyEngine(fn () => new SimpleEngine($driver, $transport));
```

## List of available components:

* [ext-soap-engine](https://github.com/php-soap/ext-soap-engine): An engine based on PHP's ext-soap.
  * **ExtSoapEncoder:** Uses PHP's `SoapClient` in order to encode a mixed request body into a SOAP request.
  * **ExtSoapDecoder:** Uses PHP's `SoapClient` in order to decode a SOAP Response into mixed data.
  * **ExtSoapMetadata:** Parses the methods and types from PHP's `SoapClient` into something more usable.  
  * **ExtSoapDriver:** Combines the ext-soap encoder, decoder and metadata tools into a usable `ext-soap` preset. 
  * **ExtSoapClientTransport:** Uses PHP's `SoapClient` to handle SOAP requests.
  * **ExtSoapServerTransport:** Uses PHP's `SoapServer` to handle SOAP requests. 
  * **TraceableTransport:** Can be used to decorate another transport and keeps track of the last request and response.
    

* [psr18-transport](https://github.com/php-soap/psr18-transport/): Leverages your PSR-18 HTTP client to deal with the HTTP Layer.
  * **Psr18Transport**: Uses a PSR-18 HTTP client to handle SOAP requests.
  * Provides middleware to deal with some common SOAP quirks.


* [async-transport](https://github.com/php-soap/async-transport/): Combines `ext-fiber` and your async PSR-18 HTTP client to deal with the HTTP Layer.
  * **AsyncTransport**: Uses an async HTTP client to handle SOAP requests.

## Creating your own engine

Every component of the engine has its own interface.
You can choose to build an entire engine or a specific component.
The interfaces look like this:

* [Decoder](src/Decoder.php)
* [Driver](src/Driver.php)
* [Encoder](src/Encoder.php)
* [Engine](src/Engine.php)
* [Transport](src/Transport.php)


### Testing your engine

To make sure that all components have the same end-result, we provide [a set of integration tests](https://github.com/php-soap/engine-integration-tests) that can be used to test your custom components.

Usage:

```
composer require --dev php-soap/engine-integration-tests
```

This will make following test cases available:

* [AbstractDecoderTest](https://github.com/php-soap/engine-integration-tests/tree/main/src/AbstractDecoderTest.php): Can be used to test a custom `Decoder`.
* [AbstractEncoderTest](https://github.com/php-soap/engine-integration-tests/tree/main/src/AbstractEncoderTest.php): Can be used to test a custom `Encoder`.
* [AbstractEngineTest](https://github.com/php-soap/engine-integration-tests/tree/main/src/AbstractEngineTest.php): : Can be used to test a custom `Engine` or `Transport`.
* [AbstractMetadataProviderTest](https://github.com/php-soap/engine-integration-tests/tree/main/src/AbstractMetadataProviderTest.php): : Can be used to test a custom `Metadata` or `MetadataProvider`.
